**File sharing – Windows XP**
=============================

**Enable file sharing :**

Simple File Sharing is on by default , so most likely you have SMB
enabled, but if you don’t or don’t wish to enable it, you can enable the
Guest Account to connect to the SMB share.

| 1. Ensure that Simple File Sharing is enabled (it should be on by
  default). To check do this : [My computer > Tools > Folder Options >
  View tab]. Scroll down in the window and make sure that “Use Simple
  File Sharing (Recommended)” is ticked. Press OK.
| Note : WinXP Home doesn’t have this option as it is ON by default and
  can not be turned OFF.

**Setting a Sharename :**

2. Right click on the folder you want to share (or Partition drive), and
go to “Sharing and Security” (sharing a drive will prompt a warning
first about the risks of sharing it over a network).

3. In Network Sharing and Security, place a mark in the box for “Share
this folder on the network”, then give the “Share Name” the name PS2SMB
(default name) – or any name you want, but it must match into OPL
network configuration.
