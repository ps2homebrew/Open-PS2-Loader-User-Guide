**Known issues**
================

-  The function that creates OPL icon in mc#:/OPL folder was broken in
   0.9.3 stable release â€“ displaying blue cube (corrupted data). You can
   fix that manually by replacing opl.icn and icon.sys files in mc#:/OPL
   by these
   `ones <https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/open-ps2-loader-0.9.3-documentation-project/downloads/OPL_0.9.3_mc_icon.7z>`__.
