**Menu screen :**

-  **Settings :** allows you to access OPL main settings. See
   :ref:`here <settings>`
   for more infos about it.

-  **Display settings :** allows you to access OPL main display settings
   (not the games display settings – see :ref:`GSM page <gsm>`
   for this). See
   :ref:`here <display_settings>`
   for more infos about it.

-  **Network config :** allows you to set your network config in order
   to play your games using SMB share. If ain’t broke, don’t fix it. :P
   See
   :ref:`here <network_config>`
   for more infos about it.

-  **Network update :** allows you to download <game_ID>.cfg files from
   OPL-CL site. <game_ID>.cfg files store 2 kinds of data : game
   settings (compatibility modes…) reported as working by users and game
   infos (such as Game dat release, Developper, Genre…). See
   :ref:`here <network_update>`
   for more infos about it.

-  **Save changes :** will save any changes you made on all of the
   settings pages. Be sure to not forget to use it after you made a
   change otherwise your new settings are lost.

-  **Start HDL Server :** allows you to install games onto your internal
   HDD over the network. It is disabled and hidden by default in OPL
   0.9.3. If you want to re-enable HDL Server, set Enable write
   operations to ON and enable HDD device [Settings screen]. See
   :ref:`here <hdl_server>`
   for more infos about it.

-  **Cheat settings :** allows you to access PS2RD cheat engine screen.
   See
   :ref:`here <cheat_settings>`
   for more infos about it.

-  :ref:`About <cheat_settings>` **:**
   allows you to know which :ref:`release type <overview>`
   you are currently running, which version of GSM / PS2RD is included –
   if not using vanilla build -, and who are/were the main OPL coders
   and non coders contributors (RandQalan, seriously ? Who’s dat guy ?
   |image1| ).

-  **Exit :** this option shares the same exit path as the IGR Path
   [:ref:`Settings screen <settings>`].
   If no path is set, using it exit OPL to PS2 broswer/ODSYS.

-  **Power off :** will place the console in stand-by mode, but will not
   turn off the power supply. This can be achieved *in-game* by using
   the |image2| + |image3| + |image4| + |image5| + |image6| + |image7|
   hotkey.

You can exit this screen and return to the games/apps page by pressing
|image8| – default (or |image9| if you changed the select button) , but
you MUST first set a device start mode (auto or manual), otherwise OPL
will not be able to display anything other than this screen.
